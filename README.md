## 🤝 How to Contribute?

Your ideas are valuable! Here's how you can help:
- **Improve the model**: Hyperparameter optimization, trying other algorithms, feature engineering...
- **Clean/refactor code**: Best practices, optimization, readability
- **Add features**: Visualizations, additional metrics, logging
- **Fix bugs**: If you spot any!
- **Improve documentation**: Clearer explanations, comments in the code

### Steps to contribute:
1. Fork the project
2. ✨ Create a branch (`git checkout -b feature/AmazingFeature`)
3. 💾 Make your changes and commit (`git commit -m 'Add some AmazingFeature'`)
4. 🚀 Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/AmazingFeature`)
5. 🔄 Open a Pull Request
